# 100 Days of Hacking

* **2013-12-31** - *Day 0*
  * Posted [introduction](http://domkm.com/posts/2013-12-31-100-days-of-hacking/)
* **2014-01-01** - *Day 1*
  * Read [A Beginner's Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)  
  It was full of really good material but was mostly a refresher.
* **2014-01-02** - *Day 2*
  * Read [An Advanced Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/)  
  But skipped the chapters on preprocessors and jQuery.
  * Read [CSS Strategy Square-off](http://viget.com/inspire/css-squareoff)  
  Learned more about CSS architecture (classical, SMACSS, OOCSS).
  * Read [Functional CSS](http://eng.wealthfront.com/2013/08/functional-css-fcss.html)
  * Read [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com/)
* **2014-01-03** - *Day 3*
  * Read [the concepts section of MDN's CSS reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#Concepts)  
  Great, programmer-friendly material.
  * Read about responsive grid systems like [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/grid.html)
  * Read about [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer)
  * Read about [SASS/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), and [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden)  
  I have used SCSS extensively but had not previously taken the time to look through the documentation.  
  Garden looks awesome and makes me wonder why we write CSS with preprocessor DSLs instead of full-fledged programming languages.
  * Learned of and read a little about the [CSS Object Model](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/)
* **2014-01-04** - *Day 4*
  * Read [Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS (SMACCS)](http://smacss.com/) book
  * Created [an animated 3D cube](https://github.com/DomKM/100-days-of-hacking/tree/9e1ae90696ea9f6a292e82fb63e0c36a6160f59d/garden) using [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) to generate the CSS
