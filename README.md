# 100 Days of Hacking

* **2013-12-31** - *Day 0*
  * Posted [introduction](http://domkm.com/posts/2013-12-31-100-days-of-hacking/)
* **2014-01-01** - *Day 1*
  * Read [A Beginner's Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)  
  It was full of really good material but was mostly a refresher.
* **2014-01-02** - *Day 2*
  * Read [An Advanced Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/)  
  But skipped the chapters on preprocessors and jQuery.
  * Read [CSS Strategy Square-off](http://viget.com/inspire/css-squareoff)  
  Learned more about CSS architecture (classical, SMACSS, OOCSS).
  * Read [Functional CSS](http://eng.wealthfront.com/2013/08/functional-css-fcss.html)
  * Read [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com/)
* **2014-01-03** - *Day 3*
  * Read [the concepts section of MDN CSS reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#Concepts)  
  Great, programmer-friendly material.
  * Read about responsive grid systems like [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/grid.html)
  * Read about [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer)
  * Read about [SASS/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), and [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden)  
  I have used SCSS extensively but had not previously taken the time to look through the documentation.  
  Garden looks awesome and makes me wonder why we write CSS with preprocessor DSLs instead of full-fledged programming languages.
  * Learned of and read a little about the [CSS Object Model](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/)
* **2014-01-04** - *Day 4*
  * Read [Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS (SMACCS)](http://smacss.com/) book
  * Created [an animated 3D cube](https://github.com/DomKM/100-days-of-hacking/tree/9e1ae90696ea9f6a292e82fb63e0c36a6160f59d/garden) using [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) to generate the CSS
* **2014-01-05** - *Day 5*
  * Perused [Solved by Flexbox](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/)
  * Read [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
  * Read [Constraint Cascading Style Sheets for the Web](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.101.4819) (1999 paper)  
  This seems so much more intuitive for describing a layout than CSS. Why didn't CCSS catch on?
  * Learned of and read the documentation for [Grid Style Sheets](http://gridstylesheets.org/)  
  GSS is a JavaScript implementation of CCSS.
  * Began reading [Implementing Responsive Design](http://www.implementingresponsivedesign.com/)
* **2014-01-06**
