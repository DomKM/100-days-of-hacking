# 100 Days of Hacking

* **2013-12-31** - *Day 0*
  * Posted [introduction](http://domkm.com/posts/2013-12-31-100-days-of-hacking/)
* **2014-01-01** - *Day 1*
  * Read [A Beginner's Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)  
  It was full of really good material but was mostly a refresher.
* **2014-01-02** - *Day 2*
  * Read [An Advanced Guide to HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/)  
  But skipped the chapters on preprocessors and jQuery.
  * Read [CSS Strategy Square-off](http://viget.com/inspire/css-squareoff)  
  Learned more about CSS architecture (classical, SMACSS, OOCSS).
  * Read [Functional CSS](http://eng.wealthfront.com/2013/08/functional-css-fcss.html)
  * Read [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com/)
* **2014-01-03** - *Day 3*
  * Read [the concepts section of MDN CSS reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#Concepts)  
  Great, programmer-friendly material.
  * Read about responsive grid systems like [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/grid.html)
  * Read about [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer)
  * Read about [SASS/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), and [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden)  
  I have used SCSS extensively but had not previously taken the time to look through the documentation.  
  Garden looks awesome and makes me wonder why we write CSS with preprocessor DSLs instead of full-fledged programming languages.
  * Learned of and read a little about the [CSS Object Model](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/)
* **2014-01-04** - *Day 4*
  * Read [Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS (SMACCS)](http://smacss.com/) book
  * Created [an animated 3D cube](https://github.com/DomKM/100-days-of-hacking/tree/9e1ae90696ea9f6a292e82fb63e0c36a6160f59d/garden) using [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) to generate the CSS
* **2014-01-05** - *Day 5*
  * Perused [Solved by Flexbox](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/)
  * Read [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
  * Read [Constraint Cascading Style Sheets for the Web](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.101.4819) (1999 paper)  
  This seems so much more intuitive for describing a layout than CSS. Why didn't CCSS catch on?
  * Learned of and read the documentation for [Grid Style Sheets](http://gridstylesheets.org/)  
  GSS is a JavaScript implementation of CCSS.
  * Began reading [Implementing Responsive Design](http://www.implementingresponsivedesign.com/)
* **2014-01-06**  
  Recruited to be a chauffeur for the day.

 Setting up a Clojure/ClojureScript library with [cljx](https://github.com/lynaghk/cljx), [cljsbuild](https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild), and test support for both Clojure and ClojureScript is surprisingly complicated.

 Took a break and ran some errands. Exciting!
* **2014-02-10** - *Day 37*
  * Watched [this presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqNevHwH47w) about [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring)

* **2014-02-14** - *Day 41*
  * Began writing a WHOIS library in Clojure
  * Realized that WHOIS is remarkably convoluted  
   Keeping track of all public WHOIS servers and writing parsers for their non-uniform responses is not something I want to deal with now or maintain in the future.
   * Realized that the [best open-source WHOIS library](http://ruby-whois.org/) is written in Ruby and compatible with JRuby 
  * Began researching how to use JRuby from Clojure
* **2014-02-15**  
  Took a break to spend time with my family.
* **2014-02-16** - *Day 42*
  * Worked on the [WHOIS library](https://github.com/DomKM/whois.clj)  
  Using JRuby from Clojure is easier than I anticipated but getting it set up was difficult due to my inexperience with the JVM. I also still don't know how to package a Ruby gem with a Clojure library.
* **2014-02-17** - *Day 43*
  * Spent way too much time figuring out how to include a gem within a Leiningen project.
  * Pushed the [WHOIS library to Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.domkm/whois)  
    This was my first deployment to Clojars. Other than the gem dependency issues it was surprisingly easy.
* **2014-02-18** - *Day 44*
  * Began reading the [JVM Specification](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/)

* **2014-02-19** - *Day 45*
  * Began reading through the [Pedestal](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal) documentation  
    Based on the [recent announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pedestal-users/jODwmJUIUcg) and the current disarray of the documentation, I'm going to temporarily put learning Pedestal on hold.
  * Began reading the documentation of and playing with [Caribou](http://let-caribou.in/)
* **2014-02-20** - *Day 46*
  * Continued learning about Caribou
* **2014-02-21** - *Day 47*
  * Worked through the [Caribou tutorial](http://caribou.github.io/caribou/docs/tutorial.html) and played with Caribou a bit more

  * Did some general reading about [Lamina](https://github.com/ztellman/lamina), [EEP](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/eep), and [Node.js streams](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html)
* **2014-02-22** - *Day 48*
  * Released version 0.0.1 of [my WHOIS library](https://github.com/DomKM/whois.clj)

* **2014-02-25** - *Day 50*
  * Played with [Hoplon](http://hoplon.io/) and [Boot](https://github.com/tailrecursion/boot)  
    Hoplon is intriguing but I'm concerned that the developers seem overly willing to reinvent existing tools and introduce (seemingly) unnecessary concepts and restrictions.
* **2014-02-26** - *Day 51*
  * Learned about Atomic Design [1](http://vimeo.com/67476280) [2](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) [3](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/02/other-interface-atomic-design-sass/) [4](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/10/21/challenging-css-best-practices-atomic-approach/)
